# ToDone
'Todone' is a simple, stylish to-do list app which based on Vue-cli 3.0+ & Bootstrap 4.0+. 'ToDone' sounds like a grammar mistake but I insist it cause 'ToDone' means 'To get the job done'. Your would and should set the deadline for each todo, so that the running progress bar could chasing your task and pushing you to get the job done in time. Totally 3 types of todo, 'normal', 'major', 'deadly', which colored in traffic lights logic. Data are save in local cookies, be careful when wipe it.
